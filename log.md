# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 17, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I fixed two bugs in my Pomodoro Central app, and released my app worldwide (except EU - was previously just released in the US, without proper localization).

**Thoughts** It was great to release my app worldwide, but it makes me a bit anxious without proper localization. Localization, and Ad consent for EEA.
